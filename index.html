            Highly effective professional emphasizing innovation and creativity in solving complex problems. Energetic
            and
            results-focused with success in developing and leading diverse teams to achieve outstanding results. Very

          <p>
            In my current position I coordinate the day-to-day production plan/schedule, capacity and forecasting
            between
            Account Management and Operations, while making sure any inconsistencies or new processes that can impact
            the
            operations at RDC, IDC, PDC, Airtech, and JDC get resolved immediately. Also, as Toggle Administrator I
            create
            new groups, add new users, edit wrong entries, review the monthly reports, and call out and fix any errors
            or
            inconsistencies from Engineering/ Solutioning team.

            As a SharePoint Operations Administrator, I apply knowledge of Ingram value streams and operations processes
            to ensure alignment of SharePoint solutions with business needs.

            I have strong leadership skills and had overseen many projects of which they have given me the proper
            knowledge. I've also had the opportunity to work in practically all departments in Operations, as Kitting/
            Production, loose piece, cargo, shipping, PGM, MH, Receiving &amp; Resource Planning; which they have given
            me the
            ability to better perform my current position as It helps me to better understand inventory management from
            when it is received until it is sent to its final destination and also it has helped me to always think
            ahead
            to prevent further issues.
